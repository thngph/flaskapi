# Red Wine ML Flask API introduction

This project is a web application that can predict Wine quality based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning (Random Forest Classifier).

Input is a 1D array of 11 features, the output is 1 if the wine quality is predicted to be good (score from 6.5 to 8), zero is bad (score below 6.5).
